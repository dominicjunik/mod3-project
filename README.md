# Trick or Tweet, A MERN Stack application

The objective of this project was to create a full stack web application using React, Express, Node, and MongoDB/Mongoose.

This website simulates a virtual Halloween experience. users create posts describing a situation with a hidden outcome of a trick or a treat. When other users interact with the post they must use the description and their wits to guess the correct outcome. 

To keep everyone feeling mischievous and in the spirit of the holiday there is a point system represented as candy. You must spend candy to create posts, but every time someone guesses wrong on your trick-or-treat you get the candy back. When they guess correctly candy is generated for them at no cost to the post creator.
